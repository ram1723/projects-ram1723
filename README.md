# **Fake Logo Classifier**

### **Project Overview**
The Fake Logo Classifier is a deep learning-based system that aims to detect counterfeit logos by classifying input images as either **real** or **fake**. This project implements two different model architectures—**Classic CNN** and **ResNet**—and compares their performance in classifying logos. The objective is to provide a robust system for detecting fake logos by leveraging deep learning techniques.

### **Installation**

#### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-logo-classifier.git
cd fake-logo-classifier

**Environment Setup**
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and create a virtual environment:
Usage
Prepare Input Data: Place the logo images you want to classify in the input/ folder.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows


Usage
Prepare Input Data:
Place the logo images you want to classify in the input/ folder.

Running the Classifier:
Run the classifier by specifying the model (either cnn or resnet) and the input image:

python classify.py --model {cnn/resnet} --input_path ./input/logo_image.png
Comparing Models:
You can compare the performance of the Classic CNN and ResNet models by passing the --compare flag:

python classify.py --compare
Model Training (Optional):
To train the models on a custom dataset:

python train.py --model {cnn/resnet} --data_path ./dataset
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of real and fake logos.
You can either use your own dataset or download a similar dataset (if available).
The dataset should be structured as follows:
dataset/
├── real/
└── fake/
Model Architecture
1. Classic CNN
A basic convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of:

Several convolutional layers with ReLU activations and max-pooling.
Fully connected layers leading to a softmax output for binary classification.
2. ResNet
The ResNet (Residual Network) architecture is deeper, using residual blocks to prevent vanishing gradients and improve classification accuracy, especially in larger networks.

Comparative Analysis
This project compares the performance of the Classic CNN and ResNet models for the fake logo classification task. The following metrics are used for evaluation:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions over total predictions.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score: For a more detailed evaluation of model performance.
You can visualize the comparison of results by running:

python visualize_results.py
Results
Classic CNN: Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
ResNet: Achieved an accuracy of XX%, outperforming the Classic CNN model.
Detailed results, including accuracy graphs, confusion matrices, and classification reports, can be found in the results/ folder.

Future Improvements
Data Augmentation: Expanding the training data through augmentation to improve generalization.
Model Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning such as adjusting the learning rate, batch size, or number of layers.
Transfer Learning: Incorporating pre-trained models such as ResNet50 or InceptionNet for improved performance.
ed models such as ResNet50 or InceptionNet to improve performance.
